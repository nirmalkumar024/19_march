    "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical procedure that allows you to summarize the information content in large data tables by means of a smaller set of “summary indices” that can be more easily visualized and analyzed. The underlying data can be measurements describing properties of production samples, chemical compounds or reactions, process time points of a continuous process, batches from a batch process, biological individuals or trials of a DOE-protocol, for example.\n",

Via feature selection, we select a subset of the original features, whereas in feature extraction, we derive information from the feature set to construct a new feature subspace.\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore feature extraction. In practice, feature extraction is not only used to improve storage space or the computational efficiency of the learning algorithm, but can also improve the predictive performance by reducing the curse of dimensionality — especially if we are working with non-regularized models."
